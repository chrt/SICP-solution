# SICP Solution
This repository is my solution to the exercises in the book [Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs, second edition](https://sarabander.github.io/sicp/html/index.xhtml). It is currently under construction, and I plan to finish by the end of this summer.

The interpreter I use is the `sicp` package of Racket.

Let me know if there is any issue :)
